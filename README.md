# AdventOfCode-2022-Solutions

Here are my solutions for the 2022 Advent of Code

#### Running the solutions

Programs are designed to run by running the file using python

    example: `python d1.py`

The format for each solution's file name is 'd' followed by the day followed '.py' (file extension)

Each program reads the test's input from a seperate file with the naming convention 'data_d', day number, then '.txt' as the file extension

    example: `data_d1.`

**Some programs were modified to complete the second part of the question using modifications to the first problem without making its own process, this will be fixed before archival happens**
